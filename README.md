# MTA-Scripts
My Multi Theft Auto Scripts - for archival purposes only

Contains my MTA:SA scripts / and maps. Any gamemode - but mainly for racing

You can download the whole directory and paste it to your existing server

List of scripts:

Whitelist: This white list script is simple - it allows only white listed people to the server - via a country (in this case: Poland) or serial. You can change the country inside the .lua script. Also if you add a serial to the whitelist of a person from another country without changing the script, it will not let him join because only Polish people can join, but this is just an example - you can use it.
30 FPS: This is a simple script, that allow you to turn on 30 FPS on the map you want. Make sure you change the map name in the .lua file for it to work. Immediately after a map start or restart, the script will do a FPS change to 30, and if you change the map - FPS go back to normal.
Soundboard: Simply meme soundboard script.
